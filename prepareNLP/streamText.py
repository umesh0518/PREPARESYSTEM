# text_message ="Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) is a procedure used to treat coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the narrowing of the coronary arteries â€“ the blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to the heart muscle. CAD is caused by a build-up of fatty material within the walls of the arteries. This build-up narrows the inside of the arteries, limiting the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle.One way to treat the blocked or narrowed arteries is to bypass the blocked portion of the coronary artery with a piece of a healthy blood vessel from elsewhere in your body. Blood vessels, or grafts, used for the bypass procedure may be pieces of a vein from your leg or an artery in your chest. An artery from your wrist may also be used. Your doctor attaches one end of the graft above the blockage and the other end below the blockage. Blood bypasses the blockage by going through the new graft to reach the heart muscle. This is called coronary artery bypass surgery.Traditionally, to bypass the blocked coronary artery, your doctor makes a large incision in the chest and temporarily stops the heart. To open the chest, your doctor cuts the breastbone (sternum) in half lengthwise and spreads it apart. Once the heart is exposed, your doctor inserts tubes into the heart so that the blood can be pumped through the body by a heart-lung bypass machine. The bypass machine is necessary to pump blood while the heart is stopped.While the traditional open heart procedure is still commonly done and often preferred in many situations, less invasive techniques have been developed to bypass blocked coronary arteries. Off-pump procedures, in which the heart does not have to be stopped, were developed in the 1990's. Other minimally invasive procedures, such as keyhole surgery (done through very small incisions) and robotic procedures (done with the aid of a moving mechanical device), may be used.After the surgery, you will be taken to the intensive care unit (ICU) to be closely monitored. Machines will constantly display your electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing, blood pressure, other pressure readings, breathing rate, and your oxygen level. Coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) requires an in-hospital stay of at least several days. You will most likely have a tube in your throat to help with breathing through a ventilator (breathing machine) until you are stable enough to breathe on your own. As you continue to wake up from the anesthesia and start to breathe on your own, your doctor can adjust the breathing machine to allow you to take over more of the breathing. When you are awake enough to breathe completely on your own and you are able to cough, your doctor will remove the breathing tube. After the breathing tube is out, a nurse will help you cough and take deep breaths every couple of hours. This will be uncomfortable due to soreness, but it is very important that you do this to keep mucus from collecting in your lungs and possibly causing pneumonia. Your nurse will show you how to hug a pillow tightly against your chest while coughing to help ease the discomfort. The surgical incision may be tender or sore for several days after a CABG procedure. Take a pain reliever for soreness as recommended by your doctor. Aspirin or certain other pain medicines may increase the chance of bleeding. Be sure to take only recommended medicines.Your doctor may delivery medicines through the IV to help your blood pressure and your heart, and to control any problems with bleeding. As your condition stabilizes, he or she will gradually decrease and then stop these medicines.Once your doctor removes the breathing and stomach tubes and you are stable, you may start to drink liquids. You can gradually include more solid foods as you can handle them.When your doctor determines that you are ready, you will be moved from the ICU to a post-surgical nursing unit. Your recovery will continue there. You can gradually increase your activity as you get out of bed and walk around for longer periods. You can eat solid foods as soon as you can tolerate them.A member of your care team will arrange for you to go home and schedule a follow-up visit with your doctor.Valve surgery is a type of heart surgery that involves repairing or replacing one or more of the heart valves. The goal of valve surgery is to improve the function of the heart and prevent complications such as heart failure, stroke, and blood clots. The surgery can be performed using traditional open-heart surgery or minimally invasive techniques and can involve repairing the valve or replacing it with a biological or mechanical valve. The type of valve surgery that is best for a patient will depend on several factors, including the type and severity of the valve problem and the patient's overall health.Recent developments in valve surgery include:Minimally invasive techniques: Valve surgery can now be performed using minimally invasive techniques, such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), which can result in faster recovery times and fewer complications compared to traditional open-heart surgery.Bioprosthetic valves: Bioprosthetic valves made from animal tissue have become increasingly popular as they do not require life-long anticoagulation therapy.3D printing technology: 3D printing technology is being used to create custom-made heart valves and other medical devices, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing surgical time.Robotic assistance: Robotic systems are being used to assist surgeons during valve surgery, improving accuracy and precision and reducing the risk of surgical complications.Transcatheter mitral valve repair: Transcatheter mitral valve repair is a new minimally invasive technique for repairing the mitral valve, which can be an alternative to traditional open-heart surgery for some patients.Artificial intelligence: Artificial intelligence is being used to improve patient selection, surgical planning, and postoperative management for valve surgery.These are some of the recent developments in valve surgery. However, it is important to note that not all of these advancements are suitable for all patients and the best option will depend on the individual patient's needs and health status.Valve surgery and open-heart surgery are terms used to describe two different types of heart surgery.Valve surgery is a type of heart surgery that involves repairing or replacing one or more of the heart valves to improve the function of the heart and prevent complications.Open-heart surgery is a general term used to describe any type of heart surgery that requires the heart to be stopped and opened. This type of surgery may be performed for a variety of reasons, including valve surgery, bypass surgery, and repair of heart defects.The main difference between valve surgery and open-heart surgery is that valve surgery specifically targets the heart valves, while open-heart surgery may address a variety of heart problems. Additionally, some valve surgeries can be performed using minimally invasive techniques, while open-heart surgery typically requires a large incision in the chest and a longer recovery time. The choice of surgery will depend on the individual patient's needs and health status."

The cake tasted good, but it could have been better. The hotel had a nice view of the ocean. The new employee showed promising potential in their first week. The service at the restaurant was excellent, with attentive staff and quick service. The artwork on display was outstanding, with breathtaking colors and intricate details.
